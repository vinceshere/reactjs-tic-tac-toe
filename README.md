# v1nce's - ReactJS Tic-Tac-Toe

## description

This is my first ReactJS project. Please ignore the lack of automated tests and code standards!


## How to run

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`npm start` to start the Webpack server in http://localhost:3000

`npm build` to generate plain HTML, CSS and JS files for deploy.
